  In the final verse we at long last learn of Michaels terrible and earth shattering punishment. The setting of the ballad changes, as the eloquent lyrics paint a picture of a harbour by the Sea at night.

  <div class="lyr16"> 
“By a lonely harbor wall, we watched the last star fall”
  </div>

  <div class="p51"> 
 The continued use of the adjective “lonely” and the mention of the “last star” falling gives us the impression of a desolate and mournful scene. Irrefutably, this is proven to be true as we learn that the prison ship holding Michel prisoner for a pretty minor crime is now leaving the coast of Ireland.

  <div class="lyr17"> 
“As the prison ship sailed out against the sky”
</div>  

  <div class="p52"> 
 The songwriter now reveals to us Michaels destination of captivity to be that Botany Bay in Australia and that he. 
  </div>  


  <div class="lyr18"> 
“For she lived to hope and pray for her love in Botany Bay”
  </div> 

  <div class="p53"> 
This changes the whole significance of this Famine inspired ballad, as it not only pays homage to the suffering and despair of the Irish people during the Potato bight, it also pays tribute to the human tragedy that was the deportation of Irish lawbreakers to Australia. In the final line of this iconic and incredible ballad we are one again reminded of Mary and her sorrowful loss after the cruelly extreme extradition of her husband to Australia.

“It's so lonely round the fields of Athenry”
