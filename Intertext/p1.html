  <div class="lyrics"> 
By a lonely prison wall 
<br>
I heard a young girl calling 
<br>
Micheal they are taking you away 
<br> 
For you stole Trevelyn's corn 
<br> 
So the young might see the morn. 
<br> 
Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay. 
<br>
<br>
Low lie the Fields of Athenry
<br>  
Where once we watched the small free birds fly. 
<br> 
Our love was on the wing we had dreams and songs to sing 
<br> 
It's so lonely 'round the Fields of Athenry. 
<br>
<br>
By a lonely prison wall 
<br> 
I heard a young man calling 
<br> 
Nothing matters Mary when you're free, 
<br> 
Against the Famine and the Crown 
<br> 
I rebelled they ran me down 
<br> 
Now you must raise our child with dignity. 
<br>
<br>

Low lie the Fields of Athenry 
<br> 
Where once we watched the small free birds fly. 
<br> 
Our love was on the wing we had dreams and songs to sing 
<br> 
It's so lonely 'round the Fields of Athenry. 
<br>
<br>

By a lonely harbor wall 
<br> 
She watched the last star falling 
<br> 
As that prison ship sailed out against the sky 
<br> 
Sure she'll wait and hope and pray 
<br>
For her love in Botany Bay 
<br>
It's so lonely 'round the Fields of Athenry. 
<br>
<br>

Low lie the Fields of Athenry
<br> 
Where once we watched the small free birds fly. 
<br>
Our love was on the wing we had dreams and songs to sing 
<br>
It's so lonely 'round the Fields of Athenry.
