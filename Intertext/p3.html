  The Ballad now moves to a very moving chorus which is repeated throughout the ballad. The chorus presumably describes Michael and the young girl’s memories together in the town of Athenry.

  "Low lie the fields of Athenry"

  <div class="p31"> 
As the song writer Pete St. John mentions on his website, the beautiful low-lying fields of Athenry can be seen as you approach the town, and it is here that Michael and the young girl imagine and reminisce of.
