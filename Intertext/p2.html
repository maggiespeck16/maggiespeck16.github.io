  <div class="p2"> 
  The ballad begins in a morose and whimsical tone by describing an imprisoned man who is standing beside a wall in the prison in which he is held captive, when he all of a sudden hears the calls of a young girl.  

  </div>

  <div class="lyr1"> 
  “By a lonely prison wall, I heard a young girl calling”
  </div>

  <div class="p21"> 
  The young girl now commences to tell us the story of Michael who was arrested by the British authorities and placed in prison.  

  </div>  

  <div class="lyr2"> 
  "Michael, they have taken you away,”
  </div>  

  <div class="p22"> 
  We quickly learn that Michael was arrested due to the fact that he stole corn belonging to a certain “Trevelyan.” 
  </div>  


  <div class="lyr3"> 
  “For you stole Trevelyan's corn,”
  </div> 

  <div class="p23"> 
  However, the ownership of the corn in question was in fact metaphorical, as it did not truly belong to Trevelyan, it instead symbolises the corn owned by the British Authorities. The corn was sent to Ireland in the guise of an alternative crop to ease widespread food shortage and tackle the hunger epidemic. However, the idea was fundamentally flawed as the farming population had little or no experience with the cultivation of corn and also it was very expensive for the peasant Irish population. Furthermore, Trevelyan is none other than Sir Charles Trevelyan who was charged with and headed the majority of the relief effort of the British government in Ireland during the Great Famine. The young girl now explains the motivation behind Michael’s criminal act, which was, to feed his young children who could not survive the pain of the Famine for much longer.
  </div> 

  <div class="lyr4"> 
  “So the young might see the morn.” 
  </div> 

  <div class="p24"> 
  Next, the young girl allows the reader to know that Michael is not facing a jail sentence in Ireland, he will in fact be transferred by a prison ship to another unknown destination. 
  </div>

  <div class="lyr5"> 
  “Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay."
