  <div class="p4"> 
  As we move into the second verse of the ballad the perspective now changes to that of the young girl, who can now hear Michael calling from the other side of the prison wall. 

  </div>

  <div class="lyr11"> 
  “By a lonely prison wall, I heard a young man calling”. 
  </div>

  <div class="p41"> 
The repetition of “lonely prison wall” is used to impress upon the reader of the loss and sorrow that this couple is suffering due to their separation. We now learn the name of the young girl to be Mary, after Michael begins to call to her. 

  </div>  

  <div class="lyr12"> 
  "Nothing matters, Mary, when you're free”
  </div>  

  <div class="p42"> 
 Michael explains to Mary that there is nothing to worry about if you are in a position a freedom. In addition to this, Michael states that he fought, 
  </div>  


  <div class="lyr13"> 
  “Against the famine and the crown,”
  </div> 

  <div class="p43"> 
however, his rebellion and attempt to steal the food was ultimately short lived as the British authorities quickly apprehended him.
  </div> 

  <div class="lyr14"> 
“I rebelled they cut me down.” 
  </div> 

  <div class="p44"> 
The use of the words “cut me down” would indicate that it was a violent arrest of Michael, although, it would not have been particularly difficult for the British forces to subdue him as none of the Irish population would possess any weapons or artillery that could pose a significant risk to them, other than any normal day tool found during that time. 

Moreover, it would not be for another seventy years until the Irish were organised or armed well enough to truly rebel and fight for Independence. As the verse concludes, Michael now consoles Mary and tells her that she must remain strong and rear their child with decency. 

  </div>

  <div class="lyr15"> 
“Now you must raise our child with dignity.”
  </div> 
  <br> 

    <div class="p45"> 
 Unfortunately, a lot of parents in Ireland during this time would have been forced to raise a family as a single parent, due to the high mortality rate that was present. Therefore, Michael and Mary’s heart breaking situation was not an isolated case.
